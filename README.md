# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Abstract: 
I built a tic-tac-toe game from scratch! Not only does this project display fluency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but it also features a unique design and allows users to play the classic game on their browser. As with the classic tic-tac-toe game, this game allows users to place their token in an empty box, determine if a winning combination or a draw condition exists, and update the player's wins.

### Installation Instructions:
1. Fork the repository
2. Copy SSH key on GitHub inside the code dropdown
3. Using the terminal, run git clone [SSH key here]
4. Run command cd tic-tac-toe to move into project directory
5. Run command open index.html to launch the application in the web browser

### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:

##### Wins: 
- Trusing in myself to complete this project with few help and more research
- Using JavaScript to update the data model before updating DOM
- Appropriate use of event delegation 
- Having fun with HTML layout and CSS styling

##### Challenges: 
- Asking for help 
- Being patient with myself
- Making functions more dynamic
